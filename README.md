TeleNote
========
TeleNote is my first app. The original purpose was to solve problems during voice calls.

During voice call, we occasionally need to take down note such as the address of restaurant for dinner, cell phone number of your valued customer…etc.
Usually we either grab a pen and write it down, or we cram every piece of information into our mind and hope we won’t forget.

TeleNote solves the problem once and for all. TeleNote allows user to record not the entire phone call but just the important part of it. TeleNote also transcribes recorded voice into text, so user can dial, gps position, or simply save the information without extra typing.

Since TeleNote is my first android app ever, the structure is not well designed. I will update a well written version in the future.
